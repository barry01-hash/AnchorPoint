# Project Documentation

This directory contains operational, security, deployment, and quality documentation for AnchorPoint.

## Architectural Decisions

- Production deployment guidance is kept separate from testnet architecture notes so operators do not mistake testnet defaults for production controls.
- The production runbook is grounded in the AWS KMS, RDS, Prisma, Stellar, and Prometheus configuration already present in the repository.
- Secrets are described by name, ownership, and injection path only. Secret values remain outside source control and documentation.

## Files

- [`PRODUCTION_READINESS.md`](./PRODUCTION_READINESS.md) contains the production launch checklist, environment contract, security gates, monitoring setup, and incident response procedures.
- [`TESTNET_DEPLOYMENT_ARCHITECTURE.md`](./TESTNET_DEPLOYMENT_ARCHITECTURE.md) describes the existing testnet service topology and request flow.
- [`security-audit.md`](./security-audit.md) documents the contract security audit process.
- [`TRACING_README.md`](./TRACING_README.md) documents tracing configuration and validation.
